defmodule FunLand.Combinable do
  @moduledoc """
  If an operation is can combine two elements, and there is a clearly defined `empty` empty version
  that can be used to keep the same element when used on an element.

  In Category Theory, something that is Combinable is called a *Monoid*.

  By doing `use FunLand.Combinable` you get an implementation of the `Collectable` protocol for free.
  If you want to implement your own version of Collectable, add Combinable with `use FunLand.Combinable, auto_collectable: false`.

  ## Examples

  - Integer-addition with 0 as empty element forms a Monoid, also known as the Sum.
  - Integer-multiplication with 1 as empty element forms a Monoid, also known as the Product.
  - List concatenation with `[]` as empty element.
  - String concatenation with the empty string `""` as empty element.
  - Set union with the empty set as empty element.

  ## Fruit Salad Example

  Bowls that you can use to mix fruits in, are a monoid:

  The `combine` operation would be to put the fruits from Bowl A into Bowl B, keeping that one.
  The `empty` operation would be to take an emtpy bowl.

  As can be seen, this follows the Combinable laws:

  - left-identity: putting the contents of an empty bowl into a bowl with apples, would be the same as doing nothing (you still have 'a bowl with apples')
  - right-identity: putting the contents a bowl filled with apples into an empty bowl, would be the same as doing nothing (you still have 'a bowl with apples')
