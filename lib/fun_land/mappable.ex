defmodule FunLand.Mappable do
  @moduledoc """
  Something is Mappable if there is a way to map a function over it.

  `mapping` means to apply a transformation to the contents, without changing the structure.


  This module both contains the Mappable behaviour, which might be added
  to your modules/structures by using `use Mappable` from within them,
  as well as the `Mappable.map(mappable, fun)` function, which will dispatch to whatever structure is passed in as first argument.


  In Category Theory, something that is Mappable is called a *Functor*.

  ## Fruit Salad Example

  Say we have an apple. There are many _operations_ we could do with an apple, such as peel it, slice it, juice it, etc.

  However, right now we don't have an apple, but a bowl filled with apples. How can we make sure we can still use all the operations we could on single apples?

  The answer: We need to take the apples one-by-one from the bowl, perform the desired operation, and then put them back in the bowl.

  This 'take -> perform -> put back' is the implementation of `map` for a bowl. It works similar for other data structures:

  Exactly _how_ to take something and put a result back, and _when_ to perform the desired operation (if we have an empty bowl, for instance, there's nothing to do)
  is what you need to define in your implementation.

  Maps the function `function` over all things inside `mappable`.

  Exactly what this means, depends on the structure of `mappable`.

  For lists, for instance, this means that all of the elements will be transformed by `function`.
  For `Maybe`, this will do nothing if `Maybe` is `Nothing`, while it will transform whatever is inside
  if the `Maybe` is `Just something`.
